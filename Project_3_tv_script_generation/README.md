## Project Overview

### Introduction
In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

### Getting the project files
The project files can be found in the [public GitHub Repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch),in the `project-tv-script-generation` folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer using :
    ```
        git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
    ```

This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with `git pull`.
